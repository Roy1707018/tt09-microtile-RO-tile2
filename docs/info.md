## How it works

Combined 4 micro tile sized projects into a single Tiny Tapeout tile.

## How to test

Use uio[1:0] to select the active micro-tile project.

## How it works

I don't know how it works, it is a doodle.

The aim is to see if a random doodle can be made to count on the 7SEG.

Maybe it can, maybe it can't, let the truth tables work it out.

## How to test

Send all possible input combinations to the project and see what happens.

It has never been tested to find out if it is possible to observe a full set
of 7SEG font states at the output.

## External hardware

None, just the standard Tiny Tapeout PCB.
